This workflow also demonstrates how to change the default appearance of a custom marker with scripting and a Unity Style Sheet (USS).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where using , and . (<>) to step frames in the Animation Window while the Timeline Window was linked would sometimes not work. [IN-56667](https://unity3d.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/IN-56667)\n- When the Timeline and Animation windows are linked and the Timeline Window is active, moving the playhead in the Timeline Window will cause the animation window to repaint immediately."
